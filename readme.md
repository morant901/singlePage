**Please check this repo**
I used a package manager to include Sass styles in the project and minify the code. If you need to modify anything, please install Node.js or NVM on your PC and run the following command:

```
npm i
npm run sass
```

The project is still watching for changes in the SCSS files and compiling all the code into style.css

## 2. Bug Fixing

### JavaScript Code Issue: The following JavaScript code has an issue where the `evenNumbers` array contains `undefined` values instead of the even numbers. The issue occurs because `map()` always returns a value, even if the condition in the `if` statement is not met.

**Original Code:**

```
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    const evenNumbers = numbers.map((number) => { if (number % 2 === 0) { return number; } });

    console.log(evenNumbers);
```

#### **Solution:**

To filter only the even numbers, we should use filter() instead of map(). map() returns a value for each element in the array, while filter() only returns elements that pass the condition.

#### **Corrected Code:**

```
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    const evenNumbers = numbers.filter((number) => number % 2 === 0);

    console.log(evenNumbers);  // [2, 4]
```

### Strategy to Integrate an AI-Powered Chatbot into a WordPress Website

**Tools and Frameworks to Use:**

- **Chatbot Platform**: Dialogflow, ChatGPT, or Rasa for chatbot intelligence.
- **WordPress Plugin for Integration**: Use a WordPress plugin like **WP-Chatbot** or create a custom plugin to integrate the chatbot.
- **WordPress REST API**: To interact with the backend and customize the chatbot experience.
- **Frontend Framework**: JavaScript to manage the chatbot interface, such as **BotUI** or **Botpress**.

**Steps:**

1.  **Set Up the Chatbot Platform**:

    - Create a bot on **Dialogflow** or use **ChatGPT** for automated responses.
    - Configure intents and entities on the chosen platform so the chatbot can understand and respond to specific questions.

2.  **Install the WordPress Plugin**:

    - Install a plugin like **WP-Chatbot** or develop a custom one using the chatbot platform's API.
    - If creating a custom plugin, use the **Dialogflow** or **ChatGPT** API to integrate the bot into the site.

3.  **Integrate Frontend with Chatbot Interface**:

    - Use **JavaScript** or libraries like **BotUI** to create an interactive interface on the frontend.
    - Connect the frontend interface to the WordPress backend using FETCH to send and receive messages.

4.  **Testing and Adjustments**:

    - Conduct usability testing to ensure the chatbot responds appropriately to users' questions.

### Using AI Tools to Enhance User Experience on a WordPress Site

**Practical Example:** A personalized product recommendation system based on user behavior on the site can be integrated. Using an AI system like **Synerise** or **OpenAI GPT**, the site can learn from user behavior and suggest products dynamically.

1.  **User Data Analysis**: Use analytics tools like **Google Analytics** or AI integrations to gather data on user preferences.
2.  **Personalized Recommendations**: With a trained machine learning model, product recommendations can adapt automatically to each user, showing them products they are most likely to be interested in.
3.  **WordPress Implementation**: The plugin can use the **OpenAI GPT** or **Synerise** API to generate dynamic recommendations displayed in a section of the site or checkout, improving the user experience and increasing conversions.
